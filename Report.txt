Does your program output any garbage? If yes, why?
- Yes the program does output garbage values. Reason being that the producer consumer processes are not synchronized. As a result, the producer floods the global variable. When the consumer ultimately gets the control, producer has updated the global variable multiple times and hence garbage values are printed.

Are all the produced values getting consumed?
- Since the producer starts first and it produces values continuously, till the time consumer starts consuming, many values are lost as a result of the producer overwriting the global variable.

functions created - 

	int isNum(char num[])
	{
		int x = 0;
		
		for ( ; num[x] != 0; x++)
		{
		        if (!isdigit(num[x]))
				return 1;
		}
		return 0;
	} 

Contribution - 100% since I am doing the assignments alone.
